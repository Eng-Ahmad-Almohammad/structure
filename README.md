# Structure
## Let's look at the following code. There are several different elements. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.

## *head*
### Before the *body* element you will often see a *head* element. This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown withinthe main part of the browser window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page). You will usually find a *title* element inside the *head* element.
## *title*
### The contents of the *title* element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).
  
  
## _Attributes_ :
### Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.
