### The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code.
### The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing </body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window.
### Words between <h1> and </h1> are a main heading.
### A paragraph of text appears between these <p> and </p> tags.
### Words between <h2> and </h2> form a sub-heading.
## Attributes:
### Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.
